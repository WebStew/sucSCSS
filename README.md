sucSCSS
======

A simple SASS CSS setup for your global cascade. There is an optional repsonsive CSS grid thrown in, still a work in progress but stands up pretty well to the current CSS within the sucSCSS project. Just remove the @import 'layout.less'; line within main.less to roll with your own / favourite grid setup.

You will need your own preferred SASS compiler either of the following are a really good bet.
I myself use LiveReload.

Less PHP : http://leafo.net/lessphp/

Less JS : http://lesscss.org/

The reset.less is roughly based off of the following approaches and will soon be updated to refrect the changes in these projects.
